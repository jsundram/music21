User's Guide, Chapter 3: Pitches, Durations, and Notes again
=============================================================

Now that you've made a couple of `Note` objects, it's time
to dig a little deeper into what makes a `Note` really a
`Note`, namely, :ref:`modulePitch`, and :ref:`moduleDuration`
objects. 


The Pitch object
----------------------------------

Since we've already covered `Note` objects, :class:`~music21.pitch.Pitch` objects
will be a breeze.  Just like how the `Note` object is found
in the `note` module, the `Pitch` object is found in the
`pitch` module.

Let's create a `Pitch`.  Like we did with `Notes`, just
class the class with a note name, such as `B` with
the optional symbols for sharp or flat, 
(*#* or *-* respectively). 

You can put an octave number after the name, but you
don't have to:

>>> from music21 import *
>>> p1 = pitch.Pitch('b-4')

Here we'll use a more abstract variable name, `p1`
for our first `Pitch`, just in case we change the pitch
later (via `.transpose()` or something else).

Just like we saw with `Notes` there are a lot of
attributes (a.k.a. properties; we'll use the term
interchangeably for a bit before we talk about the
difference) and methods that describe and change
pitches.  The first three will be old hat from
`Note` objects:

>>> p1.octave
4
>>> p1.pitchClass
10
>>> p1.name
'B-'
>>> p1.accidental.alter
-1.0

Here are two more that you can use.  The first
is pretty self-explanatory.  The second gives the
value of the `Pitch` in the older, "MIDI" representation
that is still in use today.  It's a number between 0 and
127 where middle C (C4) is 60 and C#4/Db4 is 61, B3 is 59,
etc.

>>> p1.nameWithOctave
'B-4'
>>> p1.midi
70

Most of these attributes can be changed (they are
"settable properties" in Python speak).

When an attribute is set, the `Pitch` object changes whatever
is necessary to reflect the new value:

>>> p1.name = 'd#'
>>> p1.octave = 3
>>> p1.nameWithOctave
'D#3'

And our familiar `.transpose()` method also appears on
`Pitch` as well.  Remember that `p1` is now a `D#`:

>>> p2 = p1.transpose('M7')
>>> p2
<music21.pitch.Pitch C##4>

Notice that at the command line, just printing the variable name
gives you the representation `<music21.pitch.Pitch C##4>`.  You
can also get this by typing `repr(p2)`.

As with nearly all music21 objects, we can call 
:meth:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show` method to display 
this Pitch in our `musicxml` reader:

>>> p2.show()  # doctest: +SKIP

.. image:: images/usersGuide/03_pitches-01.*
    :width: 600

So, there's really nothing new about `Pitch` objects
that you didn't already know from learning about `Notes`. So
why the two different objects?  It turns out, they are so
similar because actually every `Note` object has a `Pitch`
object inside it (like the monster in *Alien* but more
benign).  Everything that we did with the `note.Note`
object, we could do with the `note.Note.pitch` object instead:

>>> csharp = note.Note('C#4')
>>> csharp.name
'C#'
>>> csharp.pitch.name
'C#'
>>> csharp.accidental
<accidental sharp>
>>> csharp.pitch.accidental
<accidental sharp>

It'd be tedious to always have to type `Note.pitch.name`
every time you wanted the name of a note.  That's why
music21 has simplifying aliases for the most commonly
used `Pitch` terms to save typing.  But `Pitch` objects
have a lot of extra attributes and methods that `Note`
objects don't have.  So sometimes you'll need to 
dig deeper into the `Note`'s `.pitch` attribute:

>>> csharp.pitch.spanish
'do sostenido'
>>> csharp.spanish
Traceback (most recent call last):
AttributeError: 'Note' object has no attribute 'spanish'

    *By the way, you know how we said that you shouldn't have
    a variable named `pitch` because there's already a module
    named `pitch`.  You might wonder why `Note` objects can
    have an attribute named `pitch` without causing any problems.
    It's because the `.pitch` attribute is always attached to
    a `Note`, so it's never used without a prefix of some sort
    (in this case, `csharp.pitch`), and that's enough to
    prevent any trouble.*

So far, it looks like `Pitch` objects can do everything `Note`
objects can do and more.  So why do we need `Note` objects?
It's because they also have `Duration` attributes[\*], as we'll see
in the next section.

    [\*] (*Technically, `Pitch` objects also have durations, but
    they're not nearly as powerful as `Note` durations, so
    just pretend you never heard me say anything about them.*)
    
Carving time with Duration objects
-------------------------------------

For a `Note` to occupy musical space, it has to last a certain
amount of time.  We call that time the `Note`'s :class:`~music21.duration.Duration`.
`Duration` objects are ubiquitous in music21. Nearly all objects have, 
or can have, a `Duration`. A `Duration` object can represent just about 
any time span.

`Duration` objects are best used when they're attached to something
else, like a `Note` or a `Rest`, but for now, let's look at what
we can do with them on their own.

`Duration` objects reside in the `duration` module.  When you create
a `Duration` object, you can say what type of duration you want it to
be when you create it.

Here we'll create the duration of a half note:

>>> from music21 import *
>>> halfDuration = duration.Duration('half')

The string "half" is called the "type" of the `Duration`.
Music21 `Durations` use the common American duration types:
"whole", "half", "quarter", "eighth", "16th", "32nd", "64th".
Note that for durations shorter than an eighth note, we use
numbers instead of spelling out the whole name of the `Duration`
type.  Music21 also supports less commonly used types such as
"breve" (2 whole notes), "longa" (4 whole notes), and "maxima"
(8 whole notes) and on the other side, "128th", "256th", etc.
down to "1024th" notes. (Some of these very long and very short
notes can't be displayed in many musical notation systems,
but it's good to know that we're ready when they are).

The other standard way of creating a `Duration` is by passing it a 
number when it is created.  That number represents how many quarter
notes long it is.  So we could have created our half note `Duration`
by saying `2` or `2.0`.  But we can also create `Durations` that
aren't exactly "whole", "half", "quarter", etc.  Let's create a
dotted quarter note, which is 1.5 quarter notes long:

>>> dottedQuarter = duration.Duration(1.5)

As with the `Pitch` and `Note` objects we've already seen, there
are a bunch of attributes that `Duration` objects have.  The
most important one is `.quarterLength`.  The :attr:`~music21.duration.Duration.quarterLength` 
of our `dottedQuarter` variable is of course 1.5: we set it to be.
But just as importantly, the `halfDuration` object also
has its quarterLength set:

>>> dottedQuarter.quarterLength
1.5
>>> halfDuration.quarterLength
2.0

The `.type` attribute tells you what general type of `Duration`
you have:

>>> halfDuration.type
'half'
>>> dottedQuarter.type
'quarter'

The `type` attribute cannot be everything that describes the
`Duration`, there has to be some place where music21 keeps
track of the fact that the `dottedQuarter` variable has a dot
(otherwise it wouldn't have a `quarterLength` of 1.5).  You'll
find the attribute called `.dots`:

>>> halfDuration.dots
0
>>> dottedQuarter.dots
1

The attributes of `dots`, `type`, and `quarterLength` are
actually special attributes called "properties".  A property
is an attribute that is smart in some way.  Let's change the
number of dots on our `dottedQuarter` object and see what
happens to the `quarterLength` property:

>>> dottedQuarter.dots = 2
>>> dottedQuarter.quarterLength
1.75
>>> dottedQuarter.dots = 3
>>> dottedQuarter.quarterLength
1.875
>>> dottedQuarter.dots = 4
>>> dottedQuarter.quarterLength
1.9375

Or let's change the `quarterLength` of the dottedQuarter and
see what happens to the `type` and `dots`:

>>> dottedQuarter.quarterLength = 0.25
>>> dottedQuarter.type
'16th'
>>> dottedQuarter.dots
0

QuarterLengths are so important to music21 that we'll sometimes
abbreviate them as `qL` or `qLs`.  Almost everything that is
measured in music21 is measured in `qLs`.  

There are sometimes `Durations` that can't be expressed easily
as a single written `Note` on a page.  For instance, a `Note`
lasting a half-note plus a sixteenth-note can't be written as
a single `Note` graphic, but it's perfectly fine to use as a
quarterLength

>>> dottedQuarter.quarterLength = 2.25

The `type` for these odd values is called "complex":

>>> dottedQuarter.type
'complex'

*(There's one more strange* `type` *called "zero" for
Durations that don't have any Duration at all.  It's
used for measuring the conceptual length of grace notes,
spaceless objects like* `Clefs`, *Kim Kardashian's marriages,
etc.  We'll get to it later)*

The :meth:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show` method 
will show that weird `2.25` Duration, giving it a square `Notehead`
and putting it at `C4` so you can see it: 

>>> dottedQuarter.show()    # doctest: +SKIP

.. image:: images/usersGuide/overviewNotes-02.*
    :width: 600

Music21 can also deal with other `quarterLengths` such as 0.8,
which is 4/5ths of a quarter note, or 1/3 which is an eighth note triplet.
Just be careful when creating triplets, because of a weird Python quirk
that makes it so that if you divide two integers you always get back just
the integer part of the number, so 8/3 is 2, since 8/3 is 2.66666... and
the integer part is 2:

>>> 8/3
2
>>> 1/3
0

To get the number you probably want, make sure that at least one
of the numbers you are dividing is a float.  So:

>>> 8.0/3.0
2.666666...
>>> 1.0/3
0.333333...

You can go ahead and make a Triplet or other :class:`~music21.duration.Tuplet`
now, but we'll get to Triplets later.


Back to Notes
---------------------------
So now you can see the advantage of working with `Note` objects: they
have both a `.pitch` attribute, which contains a `Pitch` object, and
a `.duration` attribute, which contains a `Duration` object.  The
default `Pitch` for a `Note` is `C` (meaning `C4`) 
and the default `Duration` is 1.0, or a quarter Note.

>>> from music21 import *
>>> n1 = note.Note()
>>> n1.pitch
<music21.pitch.Pitch C4>
>>> n1.duration
<music21.duration.Duration 1.0>

But we can play around with them:

>>> n1.pitch.nameWithOctave = 'E-5'
>>> n1.duration.quarterLength = 3.0

and then the other properties change accordingly:

>>> n1.duration.type
'half'
>>> n1.duration.dots
1
>>> n1.pitch.name
'E-'
>>> n1.pitch.accidental
<accidental flat>
>>> n1.octave
5

We already said that some of the attributes of `Pitch` can
also be called on the `Note` object itself.  The same is
true for the most important attributes of `Duration`:

>>> n1.name
'E-'
>>> n1.quarterLength
3.0
>>> n1.accidental
<accidental flat>

Let's change the quarterLength back to 1.0 for now:

>>> n1.quarterLength = 1.0

`Notes` can do things that neither `Pitch` or `Duration`
objects can do.  For instance, they can have lyrics.
Let's add some lyrics to `Notes`.  You can easily set :class:`~music21.note.Lyric`
objects just by setting the :attr:`~music21.note.Note.lyric` property

>>> otherNote = note.Note("F6")
>>> otherNote.lyric = "I'm the Queen of the Night!"

But let's do something more complex.  Here I add multiple lyrics
to `n1` using the `Note's` :meth:`~music21.note.GeneralNote.addLyric` method.
And instead of adding a simple String, I'll add as a lyric the name of the
note itself and its pitchClassString. 

>>> n1.addLyric(n1.name)
>>> n1.addLyric(n1.pitchClassString)

Finally, lets put the `quarterLength` of the note as a string with a
preface "QL: ":

>>> n1.addLyric('QL: %s' % n1.quarterLength)

The format '`QL: %s`' says to put the first thing outside the quotes
in place of `%s` as a string (the "s" in `%s` means to make it a
string.  Remember that `.quarterLength` is not a string, but a 
float).

As it should be becoming clear, we can always check our work 
with the :meth:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show` method.

>>> n1.show()    # doctest: +SKIP

.. image:: images/usersGuide/overviewNotes-03.*
    :width: 600

If we now edit the 
:attr:`~music21.note.Note.quarterLength` property we can still change the
`Note`'s `Duration`. But because we already set the lyric to show
"`QL: 1.0`, it won't be changed when we `.show()` it again in the following 
example.

>>> n1.quarterLength = 6.25
>>> n1.show()   # doctest: +SKIP

.. image:: images/usersGuide/overviewNotes-04.*
    :width: 600

There many more things we can do with a `Note` object, but
I'm itching to look at what happens when we put multiple
`Notes` together in a row.  And to do that we'll need to
learn a bit about `Streams`.  So click "Next" for Chapter 4.

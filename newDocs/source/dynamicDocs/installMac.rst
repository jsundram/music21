Installing Music21 on Mac
============================================

Because Apple changes their system details so much
from one version of OS X to another, installing music21 
is probably the hardest part of the experience.  
Once you have that set, the rest should be much less painful.
Trust us that it should work.

Just follow the instructions below carefully and you shouldn't
have any problems.


Starting Python and Checking the Version
----------------------------------------------

Python is a simple but powerful programming language that music21
is written in and in which you will write your own programs that 
use music21.

Mac OS X comes with Python, but if you have an older version of OS X
(Leopard or earlier) it might not be a new enough version 
to run music21. Music21 requires Python 2.6 or 2.7 to run. Python 3 is not yet supported. 

To determine the Python version you have installed, open a 
terminal (by going to Applications, then Utilities, and then 
double clicking "Terminal") and enter the following command-line argument (don't type the "$")

    $ python -V

it should display in Terminal something like the following:

.. image:: images/macScreenPythonVersion.*

If it says 2.6 or 2.7 (possibly with a following number like
2.7.1), you're okay.  If it says 2.4 or 2.5, go to http://www.python.org/download
and download a newer version.  Multiple versions of Python can exist 
on a single computer without any problems.


Download music21 
----------------------------------------------

Download the most-recent music21 package by getting the first .tar.gz file
from the following URL. 

    http://code.google.com/p/music21/downloads/list

The newest version should be at the top.  ``Do not download`` the `-no-corpus`
version of the file.

Once it's downloaded, double-click the icon on your desktop named
something like music21-1.3.0.tar.gz -- this will create a new directory
on your desktop called something like "music21-1.3.0".  Look inside it.

You will see the following files:

.. image:: images/macScreenMusic21Folder.*
    :width: 650

If you're with us so far, you're halfway there.


Starting the Configuration Assistant
-----------------------------------------------------

The music21 Configuration Assistant installs music21 in a place where
Python can find it and lets you configure music21. 

Double click on the installer.command file to start. 
This file should open a Terminal window and begin running the Configuration Assistant. 
As this is a program downloaded from the Internet, the System will likely warn you about 
running it. Go ahead and click "Open".

After waiting a few moments to load modules, the Configuration Assistant begins. 

.. image:: images/macScreenConfigAssistantStart.*
    :width: 650

The first option is to install music21 in its standard location 
(see below, The Installation Destination). Enter "y" or "yes", or 
press return to accept the default of "yes". 

Before installation begins you may be asked for your Mac password. (The cursor
won't move or display any letters when you type in the password.  Just rest assured
that the characters are being transmitted). 
As Python packages are stored in a System directory, you need to give permission 
to write files to that location.  

(If you don't get a prompt but instead start getting
a lot of errors, you probably do not have an administrator account on your Mac.
To make yourself one, quit the installation program (just close the window), open
System Preferences from the Apple menu in the upper left corner of your screen, click on
Users and Groups (4th Row).  Click on the lock on the lower-left corner -- you'll need
your Mac password.  Then click "Allow user to administer this computer".  Then
close System Preferences and click the music21 `installer.command` button again and
go back one step.)

During installation, a large amount of text will display showing files being copied.
Sorry about the mess.  Just ignore it!  It means it's working.

.. image:: images/macScreenConfigAssistantStart.*
    :width: 650

After installation the Configuration Assistant will try to 
configure your setup. If you have never used music21 before, 
following these prompts is recommended.

Selecting a MusicXML reader is the first step. 
MusicXML is one of many display formats used by music21, and 
will provide an easy way for you to visualize, print, and 
transfer the music you edit or develop in music21. 

The Configuration Assistant will attempt to find a MusicXML 
reader on your system. If it can't find any, you will be asked 
to open a URL to download Finale Notepad 2012, a simple and free 
MusicXML reader and easy writer. Installing this reader is 
recommended for users who do not have Finale, Sibelius, MuseScore, 
or another MusicXML reader. You might want to try MuseScore instead,
which is also free and doesn't require you to register to download it.

If one or more MusicXML readers are found, skip ahead to the next instructions.

.. image:: images/macScreenConfigAssistantReader.*
    :width: 650

If you choose to install Finale Notepad (formerly Finale Reader; hence the pictures below), 
you will download an installer. Launch the installer immediately, and follow the instructions. 

.. image:: images/macScreenConfigAssistantFinaleInstall.*
    :width: 650

After installing a MusicXML reader, or if you already have 
one or more installed, the Configuration Assistant will present you with a 
list of MusicXML readers from which to select one to use with music21 by 
default. This means that music21 will attempt to open MusicXML files 
with this application. This setting can be easily changed later. 
Enter the number of the selection as presented in the list:

.. image:: images/macScreenConfigAssistantSelect.*
    :width: 650

After selecting a MusicXML reader, you will be asked a number of 
questions about working with music21. They concern whether music21 can access
the Internet, and whether you are willing to comply with the license for
use of music21 and the included corpus of scores.  You have to accept the
license to continue (we need to retain some rights you know!), but you 
don't have to give us access to the Internet. 

.. image:: images/macScreenConfigAssistantQuestions.*

After the Configuration Assistant is complete, you can close the window when
it says "[process terminated]".


Testing to make sure everything went well.
-----------------------------------------------------
We'll just see if music21 worked for you.

Open up the Mac Terminal (under Applications/Utilities/Terminal. You might want
to drag it to the dock.  You'll use it often. In the terminal window
type "python" (without the quotes).  Then type (omitting the >>> part):

    >>> from music21 import *

You'll probably get a few warnings that you're missing some optional modules.  That's okay.
If you get a warning that "no module named music21" then something probably went wrong above.
Try going step-by-step through the instructions above one more time, making sure not to skip
anything.  99% of installation errors come from skipping a step above.  If you still have a
problem, search for "installation problem music21" or "installation problem mac python module"
and see if anything looks familiar.  If all else fails, contact the music21list Google Group 
which might be able to help.

If you didn't have a problem, which is nearly always the case, then music21 has worked for you.
Test that you can get a score from the corpus by typing this command:

    >>> s = corpus.parse('bach/bwv65.2.xml')
    
Now `s` represents an entire score of a chorale by J.S. Bach.  Type "`s.analyze('key')`" to see 
what music21's best guess as to its key is.  There's lots more that you can do as we'll see
later.  But there's one more thing to test.  Let's see if you can get music notation (assuming
you installed a MusicXML reader above).  

Type "`s.show()`" or if you want to be more precise, "`s.show('musicxml')`"
    
Assuming your installation and configuration went as expected, 
your MusicXML reader should launch and display the chorale, looking something
like what we see here:

.. image:: images/macScreenShow.*

After Installation
-------------------------------

CONGRATS! You're done with installing.  You can delete the `music21-1.3.0.tar.gz` file
and `music21-1.3.0` folder from your desktop now.  

After a successful installation, you may proceed to :ref:`quickStart` to 
begin using music21.

You may need to install additional software to take advantage of some features 
of music21. For information on additional software you may need, see :ref:`installAdditional`.

You may want to configure your Environment to support opening MusicXML 
files with a different Reader. A tutorial for this is provided here: :ref:`tutorialFinaleMac`.

To configure all settings in music21 directly, see :ref:`environment`.


Installation Help
-------------------------------

If you have followed all the instructions and encounter problems, contact the music21 group for help:

http://groups.google.com/group/music21list


The Installation Destination
----------------------------------------------

After downloading the music21 toolkit, the package is installed like any other Python extension library. Python stores extension libraries in a directory called 'site-packages'. The site-packages directory is located in different places depending on your platform. To find where your site-packages directory is located, you can enter the following command in the Python interpreter:

    >>> import distutils.sysconfig
    >>> print(distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib())  

In Terminal, this looks like this:

.. image:: images/macScreenSitePackages.*
    :width: 650


Alternative Installation Methods
----------------------------------------------

The preceding instructions are for general users. 

If you are an advanced user and have installed other Python packages before, 
or want to use an EGG, SVN, PIP, or setuptools, you should read :ref:`installAdvanced`.
If you have experience working with the command line, the instructions given 
for GNU/Linux users will work the same for Mac users. See :ref:`installLinux`.
